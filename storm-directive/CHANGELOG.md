# CHANGELOG.md: Spawn Prawn

Newest first. Sessions don't edit this file: they log in `changes/<branch>.md`, and those fragments are folded in here when a branch merges into `main` (rules: `CLAUDE.md` > Change log). System names come from `ARCHITECTURE.md`. History before v9.23 lives in `NOTES.md` > Recent changes and `git log`.

## v9.23 (versionCode 273)
- Systems: weapons, combos, chemistry, loot
- Files: playpen.js (new), index.html, chem.js, data.js, WEAPON_IDEAS.md, tests (armtest)
- What: the Playpen, 20 more weapons from `WEAPON_IDEAS.md` (78 in all), flagged `armoury: 1, pen: 1`. Merged `ccr-618305e3` (the Armoury) and `ccr-d9934b1d` (four weapons retyped for an even damage type spread).
- Save data: none
- Risk: new weapons in the general pool shift loot odds; armtest guards the play-style and damage type spread.
