# CHANGELOG.md: Spawn Prawn

Newest first. Sessions don't edit this file: they log in `changes/<branch>.md`, and those fragments are folded in here when a branch merges into `main` (rules: `CLAUDE.md` > Change log). System names come from `ARCHITECTURE.md`. History before v9.23 lives in `NOTES.md` > Recent changes and `git log`.

## v9.24 (versionCode 274)
- Systems: feats, chemistry, upgrades, render, ui, audio, data, tests, docs
- Files: `newfeats.js` (new), `data.js`, `spellfork.js`, `stamina.js`, `icons.js`, `chem.js`, `typefx.js`, `game.js`, `render.js`, `ui.js`, `audio.js`, `sigs.js`, `index.html`, `meta.js`, `android/app/build.gradle`, `tests/newfeattest.js` (new), `tests/newfeatshot.js` (new), `tests/run.sh`, `tests/sim/wave20.js`, `tests/tools/guide.js`, `GAME_GUIDE.md`, `FEAT_IDEAS.md`, `ENEMY_IDEAS.md` (new, from `ccr-9082b737`), `NOTES.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- What: merge of this session's v9.23 (all 36 Feats from `FEAT_IDEAS.md`, each with two Lv 4 paths, in loot, the Tackle Box and a new Field Guide FEATS tab; the Bloody Show three-type reaction, Mucus + Blood + Static) with main's v9.23 (the Playpen) and `ccr-9082b737` (enemy ideas doc). Also fixes a crash: Rubber Johnny's spines have no weapon and broke `projHit`/`projEnd`. Two branches used v9.23, so this combined build is v9.24.
- Save data: none
- Hooks: game.js fireWeapon -> nfFire, update -> nfTick, updateEnemies -> nfSteer, shootPattern -> nfNoFire/nfAim, enemy bullets -> nfBullet, hurtPlayer -> nfHurtMul/nfLethal, updatePlayer -> nfSpeed, updateSpellList -> nfWait, featTap -> passive Feats, damageEnemy -> nfDamaged, killEnemy -> nfKill; render.js -> nfDrawUnder/nfDrawOver/nfYouAlpha and the Bloody Show squeeze; ui.js Feat slot bar -> w.nfCharge, Field Guide FEATS tab; audio.js -> G.musCutT; sigs.js projHit/projEnd skip projectiles with no weapon.
- Risk: 36 more Feats dilute Feat drafts (novelty weighting rotates them). Wave sims: 27% bot wins before, 36% with a new Feat forced in; Mosquito, Fecal Transplant, Brown Fat and Fertile Window sit at 50%. Hooks in `updateEnemies`, `shootPattern`, enemy bullets, `hurtPlayer`, `damageEnemy` and `killEnemy` all run through `G.nf` (absent until a new Feat is performed). No save-data changes.

### Folded from ccr-e8ca6f23-vawkv2: merge-friendly change logging (2026-10-16)
- Systems: docs
- Files: CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md (new), CHANGELOG.md (new), changes/ (new)
- What: per-session change-log fragments, a merge playbook, start-of-session overlap check, and the system architecture map.
- Save data: none
- Hooks: none
- Risk: none

## v9.23 (versionCode 273)
- Systems: weapons, combos, chemistry, loot
- Files: playpen.js (new), index.html, chem.js, data.js, WEAPON_IDEAS.md, tests (armtest)
- What: the Playpen, 20 more weapons from `WEAPON_IDEAS.md` (78 in all), flagged `armoury: 1, pen: 1`. Merged `ccr-618305e3` (the Armoury) and `ccr-d9934b1d` (four weapons retyped for an even damage type spread).
- Save data: none
- Risk: new weapons in the general pool shift loot odds; armtest guards the play-style and damage type spread.
