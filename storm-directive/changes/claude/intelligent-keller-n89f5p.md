## 2026-10-16 Player statuses from typed enemy bullets (v9.25)
- Systems: chemistry, enemies, render, tutorial
- Files: pstatus.js (new), game.js, render.js, chem.js, newfeats.js, index.html, tests/psttest.js (new), tests/tools/guide.js
- What: Antibody, Cytokine Caster, Diatom, Killer T-Cell and Booster bullets now carry a damage type (white mark on the speck) and give you Snotty (slower), Sick (slow drain, half healing) or Soaking wet (Static bullets hit 60% harder; washes off snot and acid). Status chips with timers and first-time cards; your Water puddles and Fecal Transplant rinse them off.
- Save data: none (new STATUS_INTRO keys SNOTTY, SICK, SOAKING WET go in the existing META.seenSt).
- Hooks: game.js eBullet -> pstElem, hurtPlayer -> pstHurtMul + pstHit, healPlayer -> pstHeal, player speed -> pstSpeed, update -> pstTick; render.js chips -> pstChips, enemy bullets -> pstBulletMarks; chem.js chemPlayerZones -> pstOn/pstClear; newfeats.js fecaltransplant -> pstClear.
- Risk: early runs are a little harder (Antibody is the first shooter, from 35s); wave-sim deaths were in line with the baseline over 4 runs. Bosses unchanged.
