## 2026-10-16 Combos batch 1 for the Armoury and Playpen weapons (v9.24, not shipped)
- Systems: combos, weapons
- Files: combos3.js (new), combos.js, playpen.js, index.html, tests/combo3test.js (new), tests/run.sh, tests/tools/guide.js, tests/tools/copy/areas.js, ARCHITECTURE.md, GAME_GUIDE.md
- What: eight new Weapon Combos (Drive-By Pramming, One-Two Delivery, Live Mains, Auntie's Revenge, Water Delivery, Locker Room Towel, Packed Lunch, Guthrie Test), one per sequence. They fuse through the usual ceremony and bonus mount, and use the standard Switched at Birth twist table. Water Delivery pairs Waters Breaking (Chonker) with Bath Bomb (Good Eater), so it needs a splice. Live Mains' overload is a held stun, not the Static reaction. "Natural synergy" lines from the brief are not implemented (only twists for swapped damage types exist).
- Save data: META.combos gains eight ids (c_driveby, c_onetwo_deliv, c_livemains, c_aunties_revenge, c_waterdelivery, c_towel_snap, c_packed_lunch, c_guthrie_test).
- Hooks: combos.js comboFire -> combo3Fire, comboHit -> combo3Hit, comboTick -> combo3Tick, comboLash -> combo3Lash; playpen.js penEnd -> combo3Pram, penFire juicebox -> combo3Carton and combo3Boil.
- Risk: Drive-By Pramming spawns many Spitballs (projectile cap applies); Packed Lunch widens Upchuck puddles for 3s; no new sounds (existing sfx reused).
