## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: Heartburn signature (returning droplets)
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/SIGNATURE_WEAPONS.md, WEAPONS.md, MODIFIERS.md
- What: per the user, Heartburn's signature is "coming back up": each droplet flies out to full range and back, hitting on both passes (the Returning modifier, now allowed on Spread). Damage per droplet 3.4 to 2.4 to compensate.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only).

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: shipped ground objects only, greyscale notes gone, tidy-up
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/COMBAT_MATRIX.md, DAMAGE_TYPES.md, DEFENCE_TYPES.md, ENEMY_DESIGN.md, SIGNATURE_WEAPONS.md, WEAPONS.md, SAMPLES.md, VOICE_GUIDE.md, tables/*.csv
- What: per the user, only shipped ground objects plus wax (decision 27): Burn zones, corrosive slicks, clot patches and Heartburn's reflux puddle are cut. Slick Move now leaves an Acid Pool, Caught in the Clot Snares the first enemy across the blood pool, Flammable Mucus flares once (a burst, not a zone), Smouldering elites give off a death Burst. Shipped terrain added to the world objects table. Acid stays shocking pink (decision 28). Greyscale notes removed (Lab view is retired). Em dashes replaced, duplicate link removed.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only). Heartburn has no signature until one is chosen.

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: modifiers stack, forks can rarely change attack type
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/UPGRADES.md, MODIFIERS.md
- What: per the user, a weapon can carry several modifiers (the two-plus-one cap is gone) and a fork can, rarely, change a weapon's attack type (mostly at the Lv 10 mastery fork). Damage type never changes.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only).

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: upgrades and progression
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/UPGRADES.md (new), README.md
- What: the progression model: one shared card draft (Acquire, Enhance, Transform, Specialise), slot caps (3 weapons at levels 1/8/22, 3 Feats with the sample's unique Feat fixed, 4 shared Genome slots for mutations and Assimilation defences), Feat levels with forks at 3 and 5, weapon forks at 5 and 10 (one mastery a run; forks use the upgrade modifier slot from MODIFIERS.md, never change attack type), a 50/25/25 sample-type pool lean, Skip/Reroll/Banish (Remove 2, Fewer like this 1) and a one-screen-per-40 s interruption budget.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only).

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: pets rule, modifiers, six more signature weapons
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/MODIFIERS.md (new), COMBAT_MATRIX.md (12.3 Pets), SIGNATURE_WEAPONS.md, WEAPONS.md, ATTACK_TYPES.md, README.md
- What: pets get one rule (damage, leash 300, 4 per weapon and 8 in total, 20% of your health, respawn 3 s, ignore statuses and hazards, enemies only target nearby pets). MODIFIERS.md defines 18 modifiers with caps (homing, piercing, chaining, ricochet, returning, orbiting, delayed detonation, lobbed, trail, self-centred, sweep, anchored beam, rapid volley, every Nth, growing, scaling, multiplying, summoned). Twin Telepathy, Blood Blister, Thorny Onesie, Seeker Siblings, Flagellum Flail and Nose Goblins become signature weapons 21 to 26 (68 weapons in all).
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only).

## 2026-10-17 Samples doc: tell, quirk and payoff format
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/SAMPLES.md
- What: SAMPLES.md rewritten in the user's format: design principle (tell, quirk, payoff), one-line roster, a page per sample (core fantasy, behaviour, named passive, Unique Feat, visual signature, consciousness, Scientist, selection-card gag), visual rhythm, guardrails and the guiding test. Rules, starting attack types (linked to WEAPONS.md section 4), unlocks and open decisions kept at the end.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none.

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: one weapons list
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/WEAPONS.md (new), README.md
- What: all 62 redesign weapons in one table set (42 matrix weapons from v10.js V10_NAMES, 20 signature weapons) plus the 34 parked originals with reasons. Flags a new name clash: Soul Purpose is both the Soul Burst weapon and the Force + Soul reaction. Section 4 maps each SAMPLES.md sample to its starting matrix weapon.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only).

## 2026-10-17 Samples design: eight new playable characters
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/SAMPLES.md (new), README.md, VOICE_GUIDE.md
- What: Eight samples (Baseline to Other Half) to replace the sequences as playable characters: types, starter attack type, passive, unique Feat, Scientist line, unlock, story and visual language each, aligned with the 26 reconciliation decisions (Soul possesses, no automatic Fire spread, Lab view retired, type colours). Profiles become trait-named builds; game modes become "Experiments".
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none now; when built, replacing sequences touches seqsel/seqlock/genes and the META.prof migration.
## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: Fire signature weapon drafts
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/SIGNATURE_WEAPONS.md
- What: five Fire signature drafts, one per attack type beside Pub Crawl's Pool: Heartburn (original `flamer`, moved from Acid), Hot and Bothered, Carpet Burn, Getting Warmer, Burning Sensation. Names checked against the code (Hot Flush, Running a Temperature and Fever Dream are taken).
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only). Moving `flamer` from Acid to Fire changes Heartburn's existing upgrades and Pairings when ported.

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: signature weapons
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/SIGNATURE_WEAPONS.md (new), COMBAT_MATRIX.md (section 12, Fear row), README.md
- What: 15 original weapons (Premature Evangelation, Nappy Mines, Pub Crawl, Peekaboo, Black Hole, Tapeworm Seeder, Red Tape, Due Date, Leeches, Static Cling, Lard Lobber, Placental Siphon, Bubble Wand, Tooth Fairy, Upchuck) return as signature weapons beside the 42-weapon matrix, each retyped to one of the seven types. New rules: echo damage, Pull, allied creatures, player hiding, bounded chains, lures, merging pools, projectile blocking.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only). Porting will touch weapon ids that have Pairings on other branches.

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: formulas and starting values
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/COMBAT_MATRIX.md (new section 11, status rows), DAMAGE_TYPES.md, DEFENCE_TYPES.md, ENEMY_DESIGN.md (Damage type column), AUTORUN_AUTOAIM.md (SHELLED, MEMBRANED, TOUGHEST), README.md, tables/*.csv
- What: every mechanic now has a formula and a starting number: hit order (Evasion, Membrane, Shell, Squishy, then crit); one build-up bar formula (raw damage over bar size x max HP, 2 s drain); heavy Force hit at 15% max HP; reaction damage as % of the triggering hit with a 1.5 s lockout; Possessed AI; Charge as a conductor; Extraction on bleeding kills; Membrane recharge only (no supercharge); defence, status and world-object values; enemy damage types on a bell curve; Snot Trap rename.
- Save data: proposed META.rxSeen (reaction discovery); nothing in code yet.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none (docs only); numbers need playtest.

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: reconciliation (26 decisions)
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/COMBAT_MATRIX.md (rewritten), DAMAGE_TYPES.md, DEFENCE_TYPES.md, ATTACK_TYPES.md, ENEMY_DESIGN.md, VOICE_GUIDE.md, README.md, tables/*.csv (regenerated)
- What: cross-doc contradictions settled one by one (COMBAT_MATRIX.md section 10). Reactions use four trigger kinds (state + hit, world object + hit, dual-type weapon, Pairing) and are identical in every doc; Soul reactions rebuilt on Possessed and the Soul Mark retired; Dodge defence renamed Evasion (miss chance on Contact, Projectile, Spread only); Acid strips Shell for good and has no DoT outside Pools; Fire uses a Burn bar with one Ignition flare and no auto-spread; Squishy blunt only; Shell layers wear slowly under ordinary hits; Mucus smothers Fire; world objects split from statuses; player can have every defence and status except Possessed; reactions are discovered; Lab view to be retired; plain internal ids to come.
- Save data: none yet (decision 19 will rename internal type ids and needs a migration).
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: decisions 19 to 21 (id rename, Lab view retired, palette) are big code changes still to do; see redesign docs/README.md "Follow-on work".

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: Soul as mind control, TOUGHEST restored, feature-file enemy rows
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/AUTORUN_AUTOAIM.md (copied from claude/zealous-clarke-i26iot), DAMAGE_TYPES.md, DEFENCE_TYPES.md, COMBAT_MATRIX.md, ENEMY_DESIGN.md, README.md, tables/mechanics_statuses.csv, tables/combat_interactions.csv; NOTES.md (one bullet)
- What: Soul is mind control only: new Possessed status (full build-up turns an enemy on its mates for a few seconds; bounded, bosses reduced); essence and resource bypass removed everywhere (Essence Drain and Soul Fracture rows gone). TOUGHEST restored (HIGHEST HEALTH was removed in AUTORUN_AUTOAIM.md). ENEMY_DESIGN 5.3 now reviews all 27 enemies from foes.js, foes2.js and foes3.js, with revisions for Litmus Cell, Mirror Cell, Platelet Clump and Grease Ball.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: v10 code may still describe Soul with essence wording.

## 2026-10-17 Enemy design doc: review fixes
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/ENEMY_DESIGN.md
- What: Fire damage and Burning separated; defence wording allows enemy-specific states that aren't hidden defences; exact triggers for Static Sock (Crackle by distance), Stress Ball (qualifying hit, reset, decay, hazard-safe rebound), Mosquito (fixed bite, half back within 4 s, not Extraction) and Snot Bubble (any Static hit bursts it); targeting policies framed as tools (TOUGHEST, which doesn't exist, is now HIGHEST HEALTH); roster uses in-game names with code ids, adds Paramecium and lists the unreviewed foes/foes2/foes3 enemies; Fire prototype order (Matchstick first).
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none.

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: enemy decisions recorded
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/ENEMY_DESIGN.md, COMBAT_MATRIX.md, DAMAGE_TYPES.md
- What: Stress Ball is fixed Squishy with a telegraphed rebound every 5th Force hit; Carrier rule (reuse reaction ingredients when they fit); one merged role list (adds Leech, Relay, Sniper; matrix section 5 renamed to match); Soul Mark is the Soul enemies' hook, Fear is selective; Static Sock builds Crackle (not Charge); one shared Poise meter for Force and tagged Static.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: the Soul wording (essence and non-physical resources) differs from the v10 NOTES line "Soul is the mind-control type".

## 2026-10-17 Redesign docs: five defences only, attack types, enemy design
- Systems: docs only (redesign docs)
- Files: redesign docs/ATTACK_TYPES.md (new), ENEMY_DESIGN.md (new), COMBAT_MATRIX.md, DAMAGE_TYPES.md, DEFENCE_TYPES.md, README.md, tables/*.csv
- What: purged Fearless, Bloodless, Fire Resistance, Soul ward and loose "shield"/"armour" wording (only Squishy, Membrane, Shell, Thorns, Dodge remain); Soul Erosion now refreshes the Soul mark. Listed the six attack types used by v10.js. Added the enemy design doc in the new vocabulary, with three Fire enemies and a Smouldering elite.
- Save data: none.
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: zealous-clarke NOTES says traits arrive with the enemy redesign; this removes them from the docs.
