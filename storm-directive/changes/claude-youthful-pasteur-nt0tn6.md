## 2026-10-16 Fix devall test on fresh saves
- Systems: ui, debug, school
- Files: ui.js, debug.js
- What: Developer mode's Unlock Everything and Reset Starters cards now render on the fresh-save samples screen (Level 0 only), so `devall` passes. Unlock Everything also marks Level 0 as skipped (`META.school`) so the full screen shows afterwards.
- Save data: none added (sets existing `META.school`).
- Hooks: none.
- Risk: none for real players; the dev cards only show with `sd_dev` on.
